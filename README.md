# Smart-Queuing-System
Build custom queuing systems for the retail, manufacturing and transportation sectors and use the IntelÂ® DevCloud for the Edge to test your solutions performance.

# Main Tasks
The following pages will walk you through the steps of the project. At a high level, you will:

- Propose a possible hardware solution
- Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
- Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
- Revise your proposal based on the test results
